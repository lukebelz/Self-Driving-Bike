# Self-Driving-Bike

This is my latest project that I will be building out. The goal of this project is to create a semi-autonomous bike via the use of lidar and cameras only.

THe foundation is a fully electric bike I built and ride for work everyday. a few components have been added to this, which include
- 2012 mac mini
- RPLidar Lidar
- Logitech cameras

The goal is to use openCV and SK-Learn to build a system including:
- Adaptive Cruise Control
- Lane Dectection
- GPS guidence

The final system wil give user a path to follow and manage red lights, stop signs, and road hazards, such as pedestrian and other animals, objects in the road way, and poor road conditions (potholes).
